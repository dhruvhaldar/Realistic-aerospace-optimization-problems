# ✈️ Real-World Aerospace Optimization & Control Problems

> **Note**: This repository showcases a collection of optimization and control theory projects I worked on during my Master's studies in Aerospace Engineering at KTH. These projects demonstrate practical applications of mathematical optimization and control systems in aerospace engineering.

This repository contains projects that bridge **optimization** and **control theory** for real-world aerospace problems:
- Optimize **spare parts distribution & inventory** using MILP/ILP  
- Implement **control systems** for nonlinear aerospace dynamics (e.g., B747 pitch tracking, four-tank benchmark system)  


---

## Features

### 🛠 Optimization (MILP/ILP)
- **Multi-period planning** for aerospace spare parts  
- **Cost minimization** across transportation, purchase, holding, and shortage  
- **Truck vs Air transport modes** with real-world constraints (capacity, lead times)  
- **Visual analytics** for decision support  

### 🎛 Control Systems
- **Linear Quadratic Integral (LQI) Controller** for pitch tracking of a Boeing 747  
- **Four-Tank Process**: nonlinear benchmark for multivariable control  
  - Nonlinear + linearized models  
  - Decentralized PI control  
  - Robustified control (Glover–McFarlane loop shaping)  
  - Data visualization (tank levels, inputs, RGA heatmaps, sensitivity plots)

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (or PyPy3.11+, but note SciPy is not fully supported in PyPy)  
- Jupyter Notebook (for running models interactively)  
- Install dependencies from `requirements_python.txt`:
  - **Optimization**: PuLP, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  
  - **Control**: SciPy, python-control, Matplotlib
